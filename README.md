# Birthday Maze üß©

A small, cozy desktop web app built with **Electron**, HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Wander through the maze I designed: follow the right path and it reveals a little, fun surprise at the end! ‚ú®

Lightweight, single-page files, and a handcrafted maze layout, perfect for a tiny interactive gift or a cute tinkering project.


## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14+ recommended)
* npm (bundled with Node)


## Install & Run (recommended)

Clone the repo and run locally (no global Electron needed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashley-andrea/bday-maze 
cd bday-maze

# install deps
npm install

# start the app
npm start
```

If `npm start` isn't defined in your `package.json`, add this script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "electron ."
}
```

**Alternative (global Electron, not required):**

```bash
npm install -g electron
npm install
npm start
```


## How to Play üïπÔ∏è


* Launch the app with `npm start`.
* Use your arrow keys to navigate through the maze.
* Reach the end of the correct path to reveal a small hidden surprise!


Here is a little preview. Happy playing! ;)
